## Return two different types w/ typescript function

The beauty of typescript is supposed to be safety. But safety is hard to achieve and at some point typescript may not let you do something that you can tell will work.

This is good. It will make you write a bit more code to explain yourself to typescript.



```typescript
let score = 0;

const playerScores = ()=> {
  score++
  return score
}
```

Hope you found that enjoyable, maybe you will find a usecase for this somewhere soon.

Happy Coding,

James
